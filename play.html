    <h4>THE STRONGER by August Strindberg_ </h4>
    <p>
     <p class="speech"> sWell, how do, Millie! Here you are sitting on Christmas Eve, as
     lonely as a poor bachelor.</p><br>
     
          <p class="direction"> [from the paper for a moment, nods, and resumes
          her reading_.]</p>
     
      <p class="speech"> <h5 class="MISS-Y">MISS-Y.</h5> Really, I feel sorry to find you like this--alone--alone in a
     restaurant, and on Christmas Eve of all times. It makes me as sad as
     when I saw a wedding party at Paris once in a restaurant--the bride was
     reading a comic paper and the groom was playing billiards with the
     witnesses. Ugh, when it begins that way, I thought, how will it end?
     Think of it, playing billiards on his wedding day! Yes, and you're going
     to say that she was reading a comic paper--- that's a different case, my
     dear.</p>

     <p class="direction"> <h5 class="MRS-X">MRS-X.</h5>[_A waitress brings a cup of chocolate, places it before_
     _and disappears again_.</p>

     <p class="direction"> <h5 class="MISS-Y">MISS-Y>.</h5>[_Sips a few spoonfuls; opens the basket and displays a number
of Christmas presents._] See what I've bought for my tots. [_Picks up a
doll._] What do you think of this? Lisa is to have it. She can roll her
eyes and twist her head, do you see? Fine, is it not? And here's a cork
pistol for Carl.</p>

<p class="direction"> <h5 class="MRS-X">MRS-X>.</h5> [_Loads the pistol and pops it at_ ] 
     <p class="speech"> <h5 class="MISS-Y">MISS-Y.</h5> _starts as if frightened_.</p>

<p class="speech"> <h5 class="MRS-X">MRS-X.</h5> Did I scare you? Why, you didn't fear I was going to shoot you,
did you? Really, I didn't think you could believe that of me. If you
were to shoot _me_--well, that wouldn't surprise me the least. I've got
in your way once, and I know you'll never forget it--but I couldn't help
it. You still think I intrigued you away from the Royal Theatre, and I
didn't do anything of the kind--although you think so. But it doesn't
matter what I say, of course--you believe it was I just the same.
<p class="direction"> <h5 class="MISS-Y">MISS-Y</h5>[_Pulls out a pair of embroidered slippers._] Well, these are for my
hubby--tulips--I've embroidered them myself. H'm!--I hate tulips--and he
must have them on everything.</p>

<p class="speech"> <h5 class="MISS-Y">MISS-Y</h5> _looks up from the paper with an expression of mingled
     sarcasm and curiosity_.</p>

 <p class="direction"> <h5 class="MRS-X">MRS-X.</h5>[_Puts a hand in each slipper._] Just see what small feet Bob
has. See? And you should see him walk--elegant! Of course, you've never
seen him in slippers.</p>

<p class="direction"> <h5 class="MRS-X">MRS-X.</h5> [_laughs aloud_.</p>
<p class="speech"> <h5  class="MISS-Y">MISS-Y.</h5> Look here--here he comes.</p>

<p class="direction"> <h5 class="MRS-X">MRS-X.</h5>[_Makes the slippers walk across the table._ MISS Y. _laughs
     again_.</p>

 <p class="speech"> <h5 class="MISS-Y">MISS-Y</h5>Then he gets angry, and he stamps his foot just like this:
"Blame that cook who can't learn how to make coffee." Or: "The
idiot--now that girl has forgotten to fix my study lamp again." Then
there is a draught through the floor and his feet get cold. "Gee, but
it's freezing, and those blanked idiots don't even know enough to keep
the house warm."</p>

<p class="direction"> <h5 class="MRS-X">MRS-X.</h5>[_She rubs the sole of one slipper against the instep of the
_breaks into prolonged laughter_.</p>

<p class="speech"> <h5 class="MISS-Y">MISS-Y</h5> And then he comes home and has to hunt for his slippers--Mary
has pushed them under the bureau. Well, perhaps it is not right to be
making fun of one's own husband. He's pretty good for all that--a real
dear little hubby, that's what he is. You should have such a
husband--what are you laughing at? Can't you tell? Then, you see, I know
he is faithful. Yes, I know, for he has told me himself--what in the
world makes you giggle like that? That nasty Betty tried to get him away
from me while I was on the road.</p>

<p class="direction"> <h5 class="MRS-X">MRS-X.</h5>[_Pause. They look at each other in an embarrassed manner._</p>
<p class="speech"> <h5 class="MRS-X">MRS-X.</h5> Amelia, spend the evening with us, won't you? Just to show that
you are not angry--not with me, at least. I cannot tell exactly why, but
it seems so awfully unpleasant to have you--you--for an enemy. Perhaps
because I got in your way that time [_rallentando_] or--I don't
know--really, I don't know at all----</p>

<p class="speech"> <h5 class="MISS-Y">MISS-Y.</h5>_gazes searchingly at_ MRS. X.</p>
<p class="speech"> <h5 class="MRS-X">MRS-X.</h5> makes a motion as if intending to speak_.</p>
